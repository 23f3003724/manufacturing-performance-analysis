## Key Findings

- The average equipment efficiency rate for 2024 was **75.24**, significantly below the industry target of 90.
- Efficiency remained relatively stable, ranging from 72.86 (Q2 low) to 76.99 (Q3 high).
- No quarter approached the industry standard, suggesting systemic or process issues.
- The data indicates a persistent shortfall rather than occasional dips.

## Business Implications

- The shortfall translates into potential production losses, higher operational costs, and reduced competitiveness.
- Failure to meet the industry target may impact client trust, market share, and long-term profitability.

## Recommendations

**Implement a Predictive Maintenance Program**
- Use real-time sensor data and AI/ML models to predict and prevent equipment failures.
- Predictive maintenance can increase uptime, efficiency, and help transition performance toward the industry target.
- Regularly review and benchmark maintenance strategies against best-in-class performers.

**Additional Actions**
- Invest in staff training focused on equipment operation and quick troubleshooting.
- Analyze root causes of efficiency loss (e.g., machine downtime, setup errors).
- Adopt continuous improvement methodologies (Lean, Six Sigma).
